Testing using pytest
No side effects
everything testing related is self-contained inside 'tests/'

need to have automated testing for these things:

- generate files for every server language
    (not sure how possible these things are)
    - test server start
    - use curl to test things

- generate files for every client language (maybe inside a pre-made project inside 'tests/')
    (not sure how possible these things are)
    - test client sending requests

- test default and command arguments (is this necessary?)

when a bug appears, create a test for it
